## Install

1. Directly from [Chorme extension store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/twitter-long-text-editor/nngipcehipjhfaabichpmaffkgbmljpm/) 
2. Download the release zip [package](https://github.com/Gaochengzhi/Twitter-long-text/releases) and install manually 



## Contribution

* This project was bootstrapped with [Chrome Extension CLI](https://github.com/dutiyesh/chrome-extension-cli), For further develop, please read their docs

TLDR:

```shell
npm run watch
```

Then follow these instructions to see your extension:

1. Open **chrome://extensions**

2. Check the **Developer mode** checkbox

3. Click on the **Load unpacked extension** button

4. Select the folder **my-extension/build**

   

* Rich text editor is supported by [Quilljs](https://quilljs.com/) and text convertion with [http-to-image](https://github.com/bubkoo/html-to-image/)



* **Current issue**: The poorly designed editor insertion mechanism (with multiple complex timers) sometimes generates two instances and sometimes none at all.
